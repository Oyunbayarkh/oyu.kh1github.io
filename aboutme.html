						<p><span style="color: white; font-family: cursive; size:12px;"> I was born in Uvurkhangai,Mongolia, and lived there until I went to University. I have one older brother. Maybe that's why i was so undisciplined as a child. I spent most of my time playing soccer outside and running around with the kids. But I've changed little by little since I was in middle school. I became interested in many things and wanted to try them. Of course, I realized that I wasn't very talented.But as a result, even though I wasn't good at what i was doing,I would keep doing it. And I'll keep getting better if I never stop trying. </span></p>
